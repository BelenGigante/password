The password options are the following: capital letters, lowercase letters, numbers and special characters. 

The user will find an HTML site where a generate password button will start the process, following; a series of prompts will display back to back asking the user to enter a length for the password (between 8 and 128), type of characters to include, after all prompts are answered the password will be generated and displayed in the HTML element.

The code includes an alert message when the user doesn't enter a number or enters an invalid character in the password length box, letting the user know a number between 8 and 128 is required and right after pops up the password length prompt again for the user to re start.
